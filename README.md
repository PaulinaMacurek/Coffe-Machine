# Coffee-Machine
Project made as part of the Python Core course at Jet Brains Academy

## About
What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. 
It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 
In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; 
if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

## Learning outcomes
This project allows you to better understand the basic OOP, its main concepts such as classes, class methods and attributes, and get a taste of Scala. 
Practice working with functions, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident with OOP.

## Stages:
### :ballot_box_with_check: Stage 1/5: Making coffee
Write a program that puts some basic information on the screen: let the machine describe what it takes to make a cup of coffee! 
### :ballot_box_with_check: Stage 2/5: Indegrient calculator
Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee..
### :ballot_box_with_check: Stage 3/5: Estimate the number of servings
Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter. 
### :ballot_box_with_check: Stage 4/5: Buy, fill, take!
Teach your virtual coffee machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.
### :ballot_box_with_check: Stage 5/5: Keep track of the supplies
Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.
